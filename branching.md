How to work in branches
=======================

git branch   - list, create, or delete branches
git checkout - switch branches or restore working tree files
git merge    - join two or more development histories together
git rebase   - reapply commits on top of another base tip


Resolving conflicts
-------------------

It looks like this:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
change 1
=======
change 2
>>>>>>> new_branch
```
